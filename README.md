### Message to the user:

I challenge AI developers or pepople who likes AI to overcome my achieved results. I strongly encourage anyone to test your AI model in this task and see if you can do better, and please let me know if you did (ilan.figueiredo@gmail.com). This repository can be used as a benchmark, study material or reference. Anyway, fell free to use the code as you like.

The code has been meticulously crafted to execute sequentially in four distinct steps, spanning from data acquisition to model evaluation. These key steps include:

1. Data Retrieval
2. Pre-processing
3. Training
4. Inference and Evaluation

Should you encounter any challenges accessing the materials, please do not hesitate to reach out for assistance.

Good luck!

Best regards,
